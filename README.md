#### I also got assistance of my colleague Chris Weir for connecting my virtual machine data base to my project

This project is a basic platform game where the user must collect the coins that are available. There are three levels after
completeing each level the user must enter a door by pressing the W key and thisbring the user to a platfrom with 3 doors each door entering a different level. the user uses A and D to move left and right and the space bar to jump. The goal of the game is to collect the coins without hitting the grass or falling off the platform, before the lives run out. 

###The project was fun to do and their is great resources however i found it difficult to connect up my database and populate the score. The user has to enter their score and it'll show on the leaderboard.
